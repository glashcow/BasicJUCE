# BasicJUCE

-Only the actual source files for the most basic audio program. At first commit it was just a volume and frequency control, not using a wavetable.

-added crappy freqoffset to the left channel (or the right i dunno)

-Deleted files, switch to wavetable, just sine thus far  

-added squaretable

-both waves can be switched between (naively)

-broken triangle added, and labels for sliders
